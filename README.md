# **The Trickster's Enigma: A Quick Game Guide**

Hey\! This isn't your average, boring number-guessing game—you're up against a super sneaky, chaotic trickster who's all about riddles and messing with you. The whole point is to guess a hidden number, but you gotta figure out what the heck their weird clues even mean.

Basically, your mission is to crack their code and find the number they've hidden. Good luck, lol.

## **How to Play**

Ready to play? Just follow these steps\!

1. **Start 'er Up:** First, make sure you have Rust installed and have cloned the game's repository. Then, open your terminal and run these commands to get the game ready:  
   To start the program, run the following from the same directory as the _Cargo.toml_ file.

   ```bash
   # Compile the program
   cargo build --release

   # Run the game
   cargo run
   ```

2. **Read the Intro:** The trickster will kick things off with a random welcome message.
3. **Guess a Number:** Type in a number between **1 and 100**. Don't be shy\!
4. **Figure Out the Clue:** The trickster will give you a response that's wild and cryptic—not a boring 'too high' or 'too low' hint\!
5. **Keep Guessing:** Just keep trying until you nail it\!

## **The Dialogue and Why It's So Weird**

The whole game is built around this wild dialogue. The trickster is a total character who loves to use confusing language and jokes.

- **Totally Vague:** The tone is all fun and games, but the hints are designed to trick you, using analogies like a "thunderclap" for a high guess or a "whisper" for a low one, all to trip you up.
- **Guess Feedback:** The game gives you different types of responses based on how close you are to the target number.

Hope this helps you get started\! Now go show that trickster who's boss\!
